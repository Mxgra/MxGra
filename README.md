# You've found Max's GitHub!

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer with a background in Computer Science (M.Sc., Uni Tübingen, Excellence Cluster ML) and Computational Linguistics (B.A.). I enjoy working on complex, messy real-world problems.

## Recent focus
- **Computer Vision** — CNNs for Pupil Detection on Low-Quality Image Data (my Master Thesis)
- **ML & Deep Learning** — I like to dive deep with PyTorch, and use Huggingface for quick prototyping
- **Automtatic Speech Recognition** — Finetuning of Word2Vec2 on a Custom Synthetic Dataset

## Aspirations
What fascinates me most about the adoption of AI is the full ML / Data lifecycle: understanding novel data and structuring it in a way that fascilitates analysis, researching the fitting methods and models for the specific use case, gathering the results and visualizing them to convey the true insights. I strive for excellence in all steps of an AI project, keeping in mind that real, practical work is not a well-paved road. 


## Past Milestones
- **Bosch Sensortec** – A great opportunity as a working student for a R&D project focusing on computer vision for smart glasses
- **Trustner** – Gathering solid experience in the backend development of micro-services for a medical messaging app
- **Academic Projects** – Explored reinforcement learning for self-driving cars, applied AI in scientific domains and data wrangling and analysis
- **Personal Projects** - Prototyped a Random Forest for stock price prediction

## What's next
I’m relocating to **Berlin** and looking for new challenges in ML-driven product development, ideally in teams where research meets real-world impact.
