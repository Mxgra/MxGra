# You've found Max's GitHub!

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer with a background in Computer Science (M.Sc.) and Computational Linguistics (B.A.). I enjoy working on complex, messy real-world problems and AI solutions. There is no boring work with data.

Iâ€™m relocating to **Berlin** and looking for new challenges in ML-driven product development, ideally in teams where research meets real-world impact.


## Recent focus
- **Automtatic Speech Recognition** â€” Finetuning of Word2Vec2 on a Custom Synthetic Dataset
- **Computer Vision** â€” CNNs for Pupil Detection on Low-Quality Image Data (my Master Thesis)


## Past Milestones
- **Bosch Sensortec** â€“ A great opportunity for my Master's Thesis and as a working student for a R&D project focusing on computer vision for smart glasses
- **Trustner** â€“ Gathering solid experience in the backend development of micro-services for a medical messaging app
- **Academic Projects** â€“ Explored reinforcement learning for self-driving cars, applied AI in scientific domains and data wrangling and analysis
- **Personal Projects** - Prototyped a Random Forest for stock price prediction
